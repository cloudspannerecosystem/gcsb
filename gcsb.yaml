# Spanner Instance ID
instance: nearby-test

# Spanner Database Name
database: nearby-test

# Number of threads (goroutines) used to generate load
threads: 50

# Number of GCP connections to establish to spanner
# 
# This value is the number of TCP connections that are established to the database.
# This value should not be set artificially high. It's default value is the number of CPU threads 
# available at runtime. 
# Please note, the database driver will block until all TCP connections are established. If this 
# value is very high, that will take quite some time before the load test can proceed.

# Spanner Connection Pool Settings
pool:
  # MaxOpened is the maximum number of opened sessions allowed by the session pool
  max_opened: 1000
  # MinOpened is the minimum number of opened sessions that the session pool tries to maintain

  # MaxIdle is the maximum number of idle sessions that are allowed in the session pool

  # WriteSessions is the fraction of sessions we try to keep prepared for write
  write_sessions: 0.2
  # HealthCheckWorkers is number of workers used by health checker for this pool
  healthcheck_workers: 10
  # HealthCheckInterval is how often the health checker pings a session
  # Values such as "300ms", "-1.5h" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".

# Maximum execution time. If set, we will run until we hit operation count, or this time limit. Whichever comes first.
# When set to 0, run indefinitely. Example: "1h" = 1 hour
